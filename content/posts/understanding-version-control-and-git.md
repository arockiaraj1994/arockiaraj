Version control is one of the foundational tools every software developer should master. In this two-part blog, we'll explore what version control is and how Git helps implement it effectively.

## Part 1: Version Control

### What is the Problem?

When working on software projects, especially with a team, some common problems arise:

- **Overwriting code:** Two people edit the same file, and one person's changes are lost.
- **Tracking changes:** It's hard to know what changed, when, and why.
- **Reverting changes:** If something breaks, it's not easy to go back to a previous working version.
- **Managing multiple versions:** Handling different features or fixes at the same time becomes messy.

### How Version Control Solves the Problem?

Version control systems (VCS) are tools that:

- **Track changes over time** — every time you save a new version, it's recorded.
- **Allow collaboration** — multiple people can work on the same project without conflict.
- **Enable rollback** — go back to any previous version when needed.
- **Support branching** — work on different features or bug fixes in parallel without interfering with the main project.

Version control provides a history of your project. Think of it as a **"time machine for code."**

## Part 2: Git

Git is the most widely used version control system today. It's fast, flexible, and works both online and offline. Let's dive into how Git helps manage version control.

### How Git Implements Version Control

Git stores your project as a **series of snapshots**, not just differences. Every time you commit, Git takes a snapshot of your files and stores a reference to it.

Git also works **distributed** — everyone has a full copy of the project history. That means you can work even when you're not connected to the internet.

### Common Git Terminologies

Here are some basic Git terms you'll encounter often:

#### Repository

A **repository (repo)** is where your project lives. It includes all your files and the entire history of changes.

```bash
# Create a new repository
git init
```

#### Clone

Cloning is copying a remote repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/project.git
```

#### Add

When you change files, you need to tell Git to track them by staging them.

```bash
git add file.txt      # Add a specific file
git add .             # Add all files in the directory
```

#### Commit

Committing means saving your staged changes to the local repo with a message.

```bash
git commit -m "Add login feature"
```

#### Push

Push sends your local commits to the remote repository (like GitHub).

```bash
git push origin main
```

#### Pull

Pull brings the latest changes from the remote repository to your local repo.

```bash
git pull origin main
```

#### Merge

Merge combines changes from different branches.

```bash
git checkout main       # Switch to the main branch
git merge feature-xyz   # Merge feature branch into main
```

### Example Workflow

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/project.git
cd project

# Make changes to files
git add .
git commit -m "Fix UI bug"

# Get latest changes from others
git pull origin main

# Push your changes
git push origin main
```

## Conclusion

Version control is not just for big teams — it's essential for any coding project. Git makes it powerful, efficient, and accessible. Mastering these basics will make you a better collaborator and coder.

In the next blog, we'll cover more advanced Git workflows like branching strategies, resolving merge conflicts, and working with pull requests.
