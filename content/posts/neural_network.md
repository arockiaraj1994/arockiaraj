## What Is a Neural Network?

Have you ever wondered how you remember your best friend’s face or how you know a mango is sweet just by its smell?
That’s your **brain’s neural network [1]** at work!

A neural network is a web of tiny brain cells called **neurons [2]**.
Each neuron connects to thousands of others like a giant spider web of messages passing around in your head!

## An Example

Let’s imagine a school classroom.

- The teacher shows you pictures of cats and dogs.
- At first, you make mistakes you might think a small dog is a cat!
- But every time you make a mistake, your brain corrects itself.
- After seeing many pictures, you can easily say, "That’s a cat!" or "That’s a dog!"

That’s how a **neural network [1]** learns by making small adjustments every time it gets something wrong.
It’s almost like the brain is saying,

`Oops, I made a mistake! Let me fix my connections [3] a little.`

## How the Brain’s "Wiring" Works

Each **neuron [2]** passes a message to the next one.
If the answer is right, the **connection [3]** between those neurons becomes stronger.
If the answer is wrong, that connection becomes weaker.

`This is how learning [4] happens by strengthening the right paths in the network!`

Just like how you get better at math or cricket the more you practice,
your brain’s **neural connections [3]** get stronger the more you learn and repeat.

## What if Computers Do the Same Thing?

Scientists looked at how the human brain works and said,

`Hey, can we teach computers like this?`

That’s how **artificial neural networks (ANNs) [5]** were born!
They work the same way the computer sees examples, makes guesses, corrects mistakes, and improves over time.
That’s how computers now recognize your face in photos or suggest songs you might like!

## In Simple Table

| Human Brain              | Artificial Neural Network        |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Learns from experience   | Learns from data                 |
| Uses **neurons [2]**             | Uses **nodes [6]** (tiny math neurons) |
| Strengthens **connections [3]**  | Adjusts **weights [7]**                  |
| Learns slowly but deeply | Learns fast with lots of data    |

## Real-Life Example

When you learn to ride a bicycle

- At first, you fall.
- Then your brain figures out balance.
- After a few tries, you can ride smoothly without thinking.

That’s your **neural network [1]** learning through **practice [8]**.

So your brain is the most powerful learning machine ever made.
Every time you practice something reading, playing an instrument, solving puzzles you’re training your own **neural network [1]**!

So next time you see a computer recognizing a photo or a voice,
remember it’s just **trying to copy your amazing brain [9]!**

### Key Terms 

[1] **Neural Network** - A web of brain cells that work together to learn and make decisions.  
[2] **Neuron** - A tiny brain cell that sends and receives messages.  
[3] **Connection** - The link between neurons that gets stronger as you learn.  
[4] **Learning** - The process of improving brain connections through practice.  
[5] **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** - A computer system designed to mimic how the brain learns.  
[6] **Node** - The computer version of a neuron; it takes input, processes it, and sends output.  
[7] **Weight** - A value in computers that shows how important a connection is.  
[8] **Practice** - Repeating an action until the brain builds strong learning patterns.  
[9] **Copying the Brain** - AI systems are modeled after how the human brain learns and adapts.
